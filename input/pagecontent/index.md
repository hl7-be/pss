This publication contains the specification for the Prescription Search Support.

The functional scope is to provide options during a prescription. The initial focus is on Antimicrobiology, i.e. searches related to ordering of antibiotics. 

Acknowledging the impact and complexity of providing feedback on ordering, the PSS project uses an overall approach taken based on the existing guidance, namely [Clinical Practice Guidelines](https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg)

Note:
* The Questionnnaires, ValueSets and CodeSystems depend on the actual guidelines, so they are not normative, and may change. They will be subject to different updates.
